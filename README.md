This is a custom POSIX compliant shell that's capable of
interpreting shell commands, running external programs and builtin commands like
cd, pwd, echo, shell command parsing,
REPLs, builtin commands, and more.
```

The entry point for this `shell` implementation is in `app/main.py`.

1. Ensure you have `python (3.13)` installed locally
1. Run `./run_shell_program.sh` to run the  program, which is implemented in
   `app/main.py`.
